SIFT+FLANN for object recognition!!!


Keypoint detection works well when background is fairly uniform.

img4.jpg is the training image.

img3, img5, img8 are testing.


Ideal is img3. we can use a similar setup for object recognition.



Change line 72 for testing other images.

You can try with your own images.

1. make sure the background of training object is UNIFORM, and with not many shadows!
2. Try with your own testing image.
